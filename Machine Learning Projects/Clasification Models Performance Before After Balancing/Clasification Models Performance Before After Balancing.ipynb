To gauge their effectiveness, we relied on a widely-used metric known as the Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) score. Impressively, Logistic Regression emerged as the top performer, achieving a flawless ROC AUC score of 1.0000, which highlights its remarkable ability to distinguish between classes. Equally noteworthy, both Naive Bayes and Random Forest models also achieved perfect ROC AUC scores of 1.0000, showcasing their robust performance. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model demonstrated solid discrimination skills with a commendable ROC AUC score of 0.9815. In contrast, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model had the lowest ROC AUC score of 0.9259, indicating that it was the least effective in distinguishing between classes. We based our assessment on ROC AUC scores, with higher values indicating superior performance in the binary classification task."
